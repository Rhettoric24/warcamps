# Highstorm System - Implementation Complete

## Overview

The highstorm event system has been successfully implemented with all requested features from options 1, 3, 4, and 5.

---

## Implemented Features

### 1. Army Devastation (Option 1)
✅ Deployed armies take 15-30% casualties based on deployment type  
✅ Chulls provide shelter bonus (5% protection per chull, max 50%)  
✅ Chull protection applies to ALL deployments and casualties (not just highstorms)  
✅ Stationed armies (at home) are safe  
✅ Active plateau runs take heavy losses (40% base casualty rate)  
✅ Shardbearers highly resistant, bridgecrews very vulnerable  

**Chull Protection Mechanic:**
- Each chull reduces casualties by 5%
- Stacks up to 50% maximum protection
- Applies to: deployments, highstorms, plateau runs, and all combat

### 2. Building Damage & Repair (Option 3)
✅ 2-3 random buildings get damaged each storm  
✅ Damaged buildings operate at 50% effectiveness:
  - Damaged Markets: 50% income
  - Damaged Soulcasters: 50% provision cap  
  - Damaged Training Camps: 50% power bonus
  - Damaged Monasteries: 50% survival bonus  
✅ Repair cost = 25% of original building cost  
✅ Shelters automatically protect 1 building each  
✅ Gravity Rigs protect 2 buildings each  
✅ Call `game.repairBuilding('building_type')` to repair

### 3. Fabrial Overcharge (Option 4 - Modified)
✅ **Gravity Rigs:**  
  - 60% chance: +3x speed boost for 3 days  
  - 40% chance: Burned out for 3 days (disabled)  

✅ **Arena Fabrials:**  
  - 60% chance: Can use twice per day for 3 days  
  - 40% chance: Random fabrial burns out for 3 days  

✅ Economy fabrials (Heatrial, Ledger) not affected (as requested)

### 4. Rival Lord Chaos (Option 5)
✅ **All players** (including you) get -20% power debuff for 2 days post-storm  
✅ Spy missions have 2x success rate for 24 hours  
✅ Intelligence gathering enhanced during storm chaos  
✅ Black market gemheart price drops to 7,500 S for 48 hours  
✅ Tournament postponed by 3 days if storm hits during one  

### 5. Highstorm Probability System
✅ Cannot happen back-to-back (0% chance for 3 days after storm)  
✅ Increasing probability: 5% at day 4, then +5% each day  
✅ Max 50% probability at day 13+ after last storm  
✅ Averages about 1 storm every 7-10 days

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Highstorm Occurrence
```javascript
// In browser console after loading game:
game.state.highstorm.daysSinceStorm = 5; // Force storm probability
game.state.highstorm.nextStormProbability = 1.0; // 100% chance
// Wait for next daily tick or force one
```

### Test 2: Chull Protection
1. Deploy a force with 10 chulls + 50 spearmen (50% protection)
2. Wait for highstorm
3. Should see: "50% protected by chulls" in casualty report
4. Compare casualties with deployment without chulls

### Test 3: Building Damage
1. Own several buildings (markets, soulcasters, training camps)
2. Wait for highstorm  
3. Check which buildings are damaged
4. Verify income/capacity reduced to 50%
5. Repair a building: `game.repairBuilding('market')`
6. Verify income returns to normal

### Test 4: Fabrial Overcharge
1. Own gravity rigs and/or arena fabrials
2. Wait for highstorm
3. Check for boost or burnout messages
4. If gravity boost: Deploy army, should see 3x speed
5. If arena boost: Use arena fabrials twice in one day
6. If burnout: Try to deploy or use fabrial, should be blocked

### Test 5: Black Market Discount
1. Build spy network
2. Wait for highstorm
3. Check black market: should show 7,500 S instead of 10,000 S
4. Buy gemheart at discounted price
5. Price returns to 10,000 S after 2 days

### Test 6: Spy Bonus
1. Have spy agents
2. Wait for highstorm
3. Launch spy mission with minimal agents
4. Should succeed with 2x effective spy power
5. Bonus lasts 24 hours

### Test 7: Power Debuff
1. Check your army power before storm
2. Highstorm hits
3. Army power should be -20% for 2 days
4. Returns to normal after 2 days

## Balance Considerations

### Highstorm Frequency
- **Current:** ~1 storm every 7-10 days
- **Impact:** Moderate disruption, not overwhelming
- **Tuning:** Adjust probability formula in `checkHighstorm()` if needed

### Casualty Rates
- **No chulls:** 20-30% casualties (harsh but recoverable)
- **10 chulls:** 10-15% casualties (50% protection)
- **Plateau runs:** 40% base rate (encourages cautious timing)

### Building Damage
- **Frequency:** 2-3 buildings per storm
- **Mitigation:** Shelters + gravity rigs can fully protect with 3-4 total
- **Repair cost:** 25% of build cost (affordable but noticeable)

### Fabrial Overcharge
- **Risk/Reward:** 60/40 split feels balanced
- **Impact:** 3x gravity speed is powerful but temporary
- **Dual arena uses:** Strong for 3 days, but only affects combat

### Economic Impact
- **Black market:** 25% gemheart discount (7,500 vs 10,000 S)
- **Spy bonus:** Makes difficult missions accessible
- **Power debuff:** Affects all players equally (fair for multiplayer)

## Suggested Tuning After Testing

### If Storms Feel Too Frequent:
```javascript
// In highstorm.js, checkHighstorm():
storm.nextStormProbability = Math.min(0.35, (storm.daysSinceStorm - 3) * 0.04);
// Reduces max probability from 50% to 35%, slower ramp-up
```

### If Casualties Feel Too High:
```javascript
// In highstorm.js, processArmyDamage():
let baseCasualtyRate = deployment.type === 'attack' ? 0.20 : 0.15;
// Reduces base rate from 25%/20% to 20%/15%
```

### If Building Damage Feels Too Punishing:
```javascript
// In highstorm.js, processBuildingDamage():
const targetDamage = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1) + 1; // 1-2 buildings instead of 2-3
```

### If Fabrial Burnout Is Too Swingy:
```javascript
// In highstorm.js, processFabrialOvercharge():
if (Math.random() < 0.70) { // Change from 0.60 to 0.70 for 70% positive chance
```

## Known Interactions

### Positive Synergies
✅ Chulls now valuable for protection (not just carry bonus)  
✅ Shelters have purpose beyond thematic flavor  
✅ Gravity rigs protect buildings AND boost speed  
✅ Spy network becomes powerful during storms  

### Strategic Decisions
- **Deploy before storm?** Risk casualties but complete mission
- **Build shelters?** Protect economy vs spend on other buildings  
- **Buy gemhearts during storm?** Save 2,500 S but limited window  
- **Use spies during chaos?** Higher success but limited to 24 hours

## Console Commands for Testing

```javascript
// Force a highstorm
game.state.highstorm.daysSinceStorm = 10;
game.state.highstorm.nextStormProbability = 1.0;
// Then advance a day

// Check highstorm state
console.log(game.state.highstorm);

// Check damaged buildings
console.log(game.state.damagedBuildings);

// Force gravity boost
game.state.highstorm.gravityBoostActive = true;
game.state.highstorm.gravityBoostEndDay = game.state.dayCount + 3;

// Force spy bonus
game.state.highstorm.spyBonusActive = true;
game.state.highstorm.spyBonusEndDay = game.state.dayCount + 1;

// Force black market discount
game.state.highstorm.blackMarketDiscount = true;
game.state.highstorm.blackMarketEndDay = game.state.dayCount + 2;

// Check army power (should show debuff if storm active)
console.log(gameInstance.getArmyStats(gameInstance, false));
```
